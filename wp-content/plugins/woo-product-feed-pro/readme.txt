= Unlimited number of product feeds =
No limitations on the number of product feeds.

= Filters and rules =
Set advanced filter and ruling per channel so only your most profitable products make it to the product feed. For example: exclude low-margin products, exclude products that are low on stock or only include products that are on sale. You name it, any filter or rule is possible!

= Field / attribute selection =

Map your field attributes to those of the channels of your choice. For many channels using the right field names is obliged.

= Fix for WooCommerce structured data bug (Elite version) =
Because of a bug in WooCommerce variable products will get disapproved in Google's Merchant Center. WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won't be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted. 

= Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version) =
Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce. Our plugin add's these fields / attributes for you so you can create a product feed that meets Google's requirements.

Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for Google Shopping. Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google's Merchant center. Also, because of a WooCommerce bug in the structured data of variable products all of these products would normally be disapproved in Google's merchant center. Our plugin fixes this bug and enables you to advertise on all of your products in Google Shopping.

WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won't be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. The plugin now contains and option to fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted.
